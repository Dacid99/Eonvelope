API Instructions
================

If you run a Emailkasten server or have access to one, the easiest way to get started with the API is via the redoc and swagger interfaces.

These can be found under http(s)://your.instance/api/schema/redoc and http(s)://your.instance/api/schema/swagger

In case that is not an option, you can find the OpenAPI schema file for the Emailkasten API below.
You can render it to a swagger a redoc page using one of the existing webtool.

To get an idea of what the different endpoints do by using the webapp first.
In addition to the features of the webapp the API offers vastly extended options for filtering.
