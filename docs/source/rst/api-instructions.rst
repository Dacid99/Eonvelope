API Instructions
================

If you run a Emailkasten server or have access to one, the easiest way
to get started with the API is via the redoc and swagger interfaces.

These can be found under */api/schema/redoc* and */api/schema/swagger*.

Alternatively you can also download a OpenAPI schema from */api/schema*.
You can render it to any api overview using one of the existing webtool.

If you have no capability to run the server, you can use the `API schema`_ linked below.

In general the URLs of the API endpoints are designed in parallel to
the webapps URLs with a prefix */api/v1/*.

To get an idea of what the different endpoints do try using the webapp
or reading :doc:`its manual <web-instructions>` first.

In addition to the features of the webapp the API offers vastly extended options for filtering.
