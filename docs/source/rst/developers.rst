Maybe you are using Emailkasten in parallel to another similar service.
Programs that migrate databases from other applications to the Emailkasten database layout are always welcome.

If you are interested in such an endeavour, please get in touch.

You can find a graphical representation of the Emailkasten database layout :doc:`on this page <db-graph>`.
We are always happy to help and give additional detailed information about the database layout.
