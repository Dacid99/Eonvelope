This is a list of frequently asked questions with their answers and quick solutions to common problems.


I am new to self-hosting, how can I set an instance up the easiest?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up an Emailkasten server is quick and straightforward.
The simplest path is described on :doc:`the quickstart page <quickstart>`.


I have found a problem with the application, what should I do?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Please try to figure out whether the problem may be specific for your setup first.
If it is not, please file an issue in one of the online repositories.

In case the problem is not related to the source code itself, there is unfortunately not much we can do about it.
Please try to debug it with other users and admins over stack-overflow, reddit or other platforms.

If the problem is security-related please contact one of the developers privately instead.


My language is missing in the translations, can I help to add it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes of course, we are always happy to include missing languages!
Translation is done via weblate. To get a quickstart look at :doc:`the translations instruction <translations>`.
If your language is also missing on weblate, please file an issue using the missing-language template.
