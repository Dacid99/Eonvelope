This is a list of frequently asked questions with their answers
and quick solutions to common problems.


I am new to self-hosting, how can I set an instance up the easiest?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up an Emailkasten server is quick and straightforward.
The simplest path is described on :doc:`the quickstart page <quickstart>`.


Do I need special hard- or software to run Emailkasten?
-------------------------------------------------------

One goal of this project is to be easily available across many platforms.
Essentially, everything that can run containers is viable to deploy Emailkasten.
That includes every modern Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, etc.


I have found a problem with the application, what should I do?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Please try to figure out whether the problem may be specific for your setup first.
If it is not, please file an issue in one of the online repositories.

In case the problem is not related to the source code itself,
there is unfortunately not much we can do about it.
Please try to debug it with other users and admins over stack-overflow, reddit or other platforms.

If the problem is security-related please contact one of the developers privately instead.


My language is missing in the translations, can I help to add it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes of course, we are always happy to include missing languages!

Translation is done via weblate.
To get a quickstart look at :doc:`the translations instruction <translations>`.
If your language is also missing on weblate,
please file an issue using the missing-language template.


Parts of the user interface are not accessible to my device, what can I do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to us that everyone can use Emailkasten with as few barriers as possible.

If you find a part of the frontend that lacks accessibility or is confusing or flawd in this regard
please don't hesitate to let us know via an issue using the missing-accessibility template.


How can I contribute to this project?
-------------------------------------

Everyone is welcome to help with the development of Emailkasten!

To get you off to a good start please check out the quickstart and codestyle guidelines.
You can find them and the source code documentation in the :doc:`developers section <developers>`.


Do I need a license to use this application?
--------------------------------------------

This project is licensed under the :doc:`AGPLv3 license <license>`.
That means that everyone can freely use this software.

There is only a restriction if you want to alter and publish the source code.
In that case your version of the program has to be released under the same license,
so the project remains free software.
