Instructions
============

These pages serve as user instructions for the Emailkasten application.

If you are a user and looking for guidance, you are in the right place.
In case you administrate an instance, look at the configuration or installation page.

The main concepts of the application are best explained along the webapp interface.
These concepts can be transfered to the use of the api which offers endpoints for analogous actions.
