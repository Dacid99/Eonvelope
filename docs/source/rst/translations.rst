Translations
============

We are striving to support as many languages as possible to make the application accessible to everyone.

If you want to add a language that is missing, you can go to weblate and select that language.

Weblate will then show you the words, phrases and sentence snippets from the application that need to be translated to your language.
In case your language isn't available on weblate please file an issue with this project and we will make sure to add it.
