Translations
============

We are striving to support as many languages as possible
to make the application accessible to everyone!

If you want to help with translating,
you can go to `the weblate page <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/emailkasten/>`_ and select
your language.

In case that language isn't available yet,
please file an issue (using the missing-language template) and we will make sure
to add the necessary files and provide them for translation via weblate.


If you don't have a weblate account you can either sign up to translate yourself.
Even if not signed up, you can still submit suggestions for translations.

`Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/emailkasten/>`_ will show you the words, phrases and sentence snippets
from the application that need to be translated to your language.
If you need context for the translation,
there is also always a link to the relevant source code position in the bottom right.

Please do not use AI tools or other types of computer translation.
We want translations that are created by real people with a feel for context and intent.
