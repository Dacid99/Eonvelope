Translations
============

We are striving to support as many languages as possible
to make the application accessible to everyone!

If you want to add a language that is missing, you can go to `the weblate page <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/emailkasten/>`_ and select
that language.

If you don't have a weblate account you can either sign up to translate yourself.
Even if not signed up, you can still submit suggestions for translations.

`Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/emailkasten/>`_ will then show you the words, phrases and sentence snippets
from the application that need to be translated to your language.
In case your language isn't available on weblate
please file an issue (using the missing-language template) with this project and we will make sure to add it.
